# LeetCode
I love leetcode, as it help me learn data structure and algorithm (DSA).
leetcode help me improve my problem solving skills in an interactive and fun way.

### Whats this repository?
This is my solution to leetcode problems, It's not clean, and maybe some files are buggy, it's only for personal usage.


### What languages are used?
My main focus was on the language, Python, but as I start studying DSA my point of view changed from language to the logic behind it, so some times I try to solve some problems with different languages.
After a while I see Java and .Net comprehensive data structures that we don't have in python, like sorted dictionary, or linked list, we have `deque` but it doesn't have node, so it doesn't have add before or after, but .Net has these methods.
below I list used languages:
1- Python
2- Go
